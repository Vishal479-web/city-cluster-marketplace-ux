## Key UX Decisions

1. **Intent before City**
   Understanding the project stage first allows more accurate recommendations.

2. **Recommendation over Choice**
   Suggesting clusters or individuals reduces decision fatigue and builds trust.

3. **Cost Ranges Instead of Fixed Prices**
   Communicates realism in hardware projects and sets correct expectations.
