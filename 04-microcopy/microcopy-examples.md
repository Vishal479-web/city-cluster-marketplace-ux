## Low-Fidelity Wireframes (Desktop)

Key Screens:
1. Intent selection screen (idea, prototype, production)
2. City selection screen with limited options
3. Engagement recommendation (cluster vs freelancer)
4. Profile listing with trust signals
5. Profile detail with cost & timeline ranges

Wireframes focus on clarity, not visual polish.
Final UI is implemented in Pixso.
